## Install fom source

If you want to build `pyobsplot` from source, you'll have to follow these steps:

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) dependency management system
- Clone the repository
- Install Python dependencies with : `poetry install`
- Install JavaScript dependencies with : `npm install`

`pyobsplot` uses the [anywidget](https://anywidget.dev) Jupyter widget framework. Python source code is in `src/pyobsplot`. JavaScript and CSS source code is in `js/`.

## JavaScript modification and bundling

Each time JavaScript or CSS code is modified in the `js/` directory, it must be bundled with one of the following scripts:

```sh
# Bundle only once
npm run bundle
# Bundle and watch for code change
npm run watch
```

The result is put into `src/pyobsplot/static`. 

## Tests

`pyobsplot` comes with three types of tests : Python test, JavaScript tests and Visual regression tests.

To run Python tests, use:

```sh
npm run pytest
```

To run JavaScript tests, use:

```sh
npm run jstest
```

Visual regression tests allow to test if generated plots stay the same. They use the [galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/galata) framework. To run them you first have to start a specific Jupyter instance with:

```sh
npm run uistart
```

If you use visual regression tests for the first time, you have to generate reference images with:

```sh
# Create / update reference images
npm run uitest:update
```

After that, you can test that currently generated images are the same as the reference one with:

```sh
# Compare with reference images
npm run uitest
```
